Description: The ability to tune models is important. 'finetune' enhances the
 'tune' package by providing more  specialized methods for finding reasonable
 values of model tuning parameters.  Two racing methods described by Kuhn (2014)
 <arXiv:1405.6974> are included. An  iterative search method using generalized
 simulated annealing (Bohachevsky, Johnson and Stein, 1986)
 <doi:10.1080/00401706.1986.10488128> is also included.
